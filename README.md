👋 Hi, I’m Janani Pradeep.

💼 I'm a data enthusiast currently pursuing Master's in Computer Science.

💡 I’m interested in analysis and prediction related to product analytics and user experiences. My work typically focuses on A/B (hypothesis) testing, predictive analytics, reporting & insights, and defining new metrics. The tools I primarily use are Python, R, SQL, PowerBI, and Google Cloud BigQuery.

🎯 I’m currently working on translating complex Clinical Trials Data into simplified terms to enhancing readability and accessibility to wider audience.
